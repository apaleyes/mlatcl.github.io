Run the group's ad-hoc seminar series. Ad-hoc seminars are seminars hosted by the group for visitors who happen to be in town and we'd like to hear from. They occur as and when we can find a slot and a relevant room.

Organising the ad-hoc seminar series involves booking the room, setting up meetings for the visitor and updating our seminar site.
