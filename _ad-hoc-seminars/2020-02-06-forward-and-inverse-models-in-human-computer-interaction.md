    Roderick Murray-Smith is a Professor of Computing Science at Glasgow University, 
    leading the Inference, Dynamics and Interaction research group, and heads the 
    60-strong Section on Information, Data and Analysis, which also includes the Information 
    Retrieval, Computer Vision & Autonomous systems and KDE Big Data groups. He works in the 
    overlap between machine learning, interaction design and control theory. In recent years 
    his research has included multimodal sensor-based interaction with mobile devices, 
    mobile spatial interaction, AR/VR, Brain-Computer interaction and nonparametric machine 
    learning. Prior to this he held positions at the Hamilton Institute, NUIM , Technical 
    University of Denmark, M.I.T. (Mike Jordan’s lab), and Daimler-Benz Research, Berlin, and 
    is the Director of SICSA , the Scottish Informatics and Computing Science Alliance (all 
    academic CS departments in Scotland). He works closely with the mobile phone industry, 
    having worked together with Nokia, Samsung, FT/Orange, Microsoft and Bang & Olufsen. 
    He was a member of Nokia’s Scientific Advisory Board and a member of the Scientific 
    Advisory Board for the Finnish Centre of Excellence in Computational Inference Research. 
    He has co-authored three edited volumes, 38 journal papers, 21 book chapters, and 
    over 100 conference papers.
abstract: >
  I will give a brief overview of the research activities in the
  Information, Data & Analysis Section at the University of Glasgow,
  touching on some of our recent applications of Machine Learning in
  optics, nuclear physics & gravitational waves, and our Closed-loop
  Data Science research project.

  I will then outline the role of computational methods in the design
  of human-computer interaction, and more specifically the role of
  forward and inverse modelling approaches. Causal, forward models
  tend to be easier to specify and simulate, but the inverse problem
  (‘what was the user’s intention’) is what typically needs to be
  solved in an HCI context. We illustrate the core issues in a case
  study, where we quantify the accuracy with which single finger 3D
  position (x,y,z) and pose (pitch and yaw) can be inferred in real
  time on a mobile device using recent developments in capacitive
  sensing technology which can sense the finger up to 5cm above a
  mobile phone screen. We use machine learning to develop data-driven
  models to infer position, pose and sensor readings, based on three
  approaches to gathering training data: 1. data generated by
  robots, 2. data from electrostatic simulators and 3. human-generated
  data. A forward model is trained on this data using a deep
  convolutional network. This emulation can accelerate the
  electrostatic simulation performance with a speedup factor of 2.4
  million. We compare forward and inverse model approaches to
  inference of finger pose and fuse them with a probabilistic
  filter. This combination of forward and inverse models improves
  performance over previous inverse-only approaches, giving the most
  accurate reported results on inferring 3D position and pose with a
  mobile phone capacitive sensor. I will then give an outlook on how
  we can improve on this with recently developed variational inference
  approaches, and discuss the potential of these methods for moving
  towards a more constructive human model-based pipeline for design of
  human-computer systems.
