Welcome!

Today we're launching a small site for the ML@CL interest group.

Cambridge University already has a world leading machine learning group in the Engineering Department, but recently we've also been hiring staff in the Computer Lab. As well as Sean Holden, there is now Neil Lawrence. 

This site will act as a repository for events in this emerging group.
